# üìä Brunto-Electronics-Sales-Performance-Dashboard-with-Excel

## üìåProject Overview

The Brunto Electronics Sales Performance Dashboard was developed to visualize key sales and profitability metrics, helping stakeholders monitor performance, identify top-selling products, and make data-driven decisions.
The dashboard provides an at-a-glance summary of total sales, product performance, regional sales trends, and salesperson efficiency ‚Äî all consolidated into a single professional Excel interface.


## ‚ö†Ô∏èProblem Statement

Monitoring and understanding sales performance is crucial for any business aiming to maximize revenue and improve efficiency. Brunto Electronics faced challenges in tracking sales data effectively, identifying top-performing products, and measuring salesperson productivity. Manual reporting made it difficult for managers to detect trends, evaluate performance, and make informed business decisions.

The objective of this project is to build a Sales Performance Dashboard that provides real-time insights into sales metrics, profitability, and regional trends to support data-driven decision-making. Specifically, the project seeks to answer:

1.  What are the main factors driving total sales and profitability across products and regions?

2. Which salespersons and regions contribute the most to overall revenue?

3. How do sales and profit trends vary over time?

4. Which products or customers should the company prioritize to increase revenue and improve performance?
