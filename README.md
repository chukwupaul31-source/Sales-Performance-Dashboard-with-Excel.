# üìä Brunto-Electronics-Sales-Performance-Dashboard-with-Excel

## üìåProject Overview

The Brunto Electronics Sales Performance Dashboard was developed to visualize key sales and profitability metrics, helping stakeholders monitor performance, identify top-selling products, and make data-driven decisions.
The dashboard provides an at-a-glance summary of total sales, product performance, regional sales trends, and salesperson efficiency ‚Äî all consolidated into a single professional Excel interface.


## ‚ö†Ô∏èProblem Statement

Monitoring and understanding sales performance is crucial for any business aiming to maximize revenue and improve efficiency. Brunto Electronics faced challenges in tracking sales data effectively, identifying top-performing products, and measuring salesperson productivity. Manual reporting made it difficult for managers to detect trends, evaluate performance, and make informed business decisions.

The objective of this project is to build a Sales Performance Dashboard that provides real-time insights into sales metrics, profitability, and regional trends to support data-driven decision-making. Specifically, the project seeks to answer:

1.  What are the main factors driving total sales and profitability across products and regions?

2. Which salespersons and regions contribute the most to overall revenue?

3. How do sales and profit trends vary over time?

4. Which products or customers should the company prioritize to increase revenue and improve performance?


## ‚ú®Key Features

- Sales Trends Over Time: Interactive charts visualize total sales by order date, enabling quick identification of peak periods and seasonal fluctuations.

- Product Performance: A detailed analysis of sales and profits by items reveals which products drive the highest revenue.

- Salesperson Comparison: Visuals display each salesperson‚Äôs total sales, helping management assess individual performance.

- Regional Insights: Regional analysis shows which sales territories generate the most revenue.

- Single-Page Dashboard: All visuals are organized on one Excel page for a quick and comprehensive overview.


## ‚öíÔ∏èMethodology

The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel. The dataset contains information on various sales attributes, including order dates, items, quantity sold, total sales, profits, customers, and sales representatives. The following steps were taken to analyze and visualize the data:

- Data Cleaning and Preparation with Excel:
I began by importing the raw sales dataset into Excel. Using built-in tools and functions, I performed data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring accuracy and consistency across all records.

- Data Processing and Calculations:
I applied essential Excel formulas and functions (SUMIFS, AVERAGEIFS, IF, VLOOKUP, etc.) to calculate metrics such as total sales, average sales, profit margins, and customer performance indicators.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
I conducted exploratory analysis using Pivot Tables and charts to identify sales patterns, track performance over time, and uncover key trends across products, customers, and regions.

- Data Visualization and Dashboard Design:
I created an interactive and visually appealing Excel Dashboard using Pivot Charts, slicers, and conditional formatting. This dashboard provided a comprehensive summary of all sales metrics, making it easy for stakeholders to monitor key KPIs and gain actionable business insights.

## üìàKey Insights and Findings

Here are a few insights that were discovered from the Sales Performance Dashboard analysis:

- Product Profitability: Specific items such as Video Games generated the highest average and total sales, making them key drivers of overall business revenue.

- Regional Sales Trends: The West Region showed the highest total sales, highlighting it as the most profitable market, while the Central Region maintained a consistent average sales performance.

- Goal Tracking: The sales percentage gauge chart demonstrated progress toward achieving the company‚Äôs sales targets, providing a clear visual of team performance against goals.

- Product Mix Variation: Items with lower average sales but high maximum sales indicate seasonal or campaign-based buying patterns that can inform future promotions and marketing strategies.

## üí°Recommendations

Based on my analysis from the Sales Performance Dashboard, here are some practical steps the company can take to improve sales and profits:

1. Focus on High-Performing Products:
Products like Video Games that bring in the highest sales should get more marketing and stock priority. Keeping enough of these products available will help maintain strong sales numbers.

2. Support Low-Selling Products:
Products with low sales but good potential should be promoted through discounts or special offers to boost demand and attract more customers.


3. Reward Top Salespersons:
Salespersons who constantly meet or exceed their targets should be recognized and rewarded. This can motivate others to improve their performance too.


4. Improve Sales Training:
Some salespersons had lower performance levels. Extra training or mentorship can help them learn from top sellers and improve their results.


5. Use Regional Insights:
The West Region performed best, while other regions like Central and East can learn from the strategies used there. Focus on what works well in the top regions to boost sales everywhere.


6. Plan for Peak Periods:
The sales trend showed some months with higher performance. The company should plan stock and promotions around those months to make the most of peak seasons.


7. Set Realistic Sales Goals:
The dashboard‚Äôs goal tracking chart helps see how close sales are to the target. Setting clear and reachable targets will motivate the sales team and make it easier to track progress.


8. Customer Relationship:
Keep close contact with loyal customers who buy frequently. Special deals or thank-you messages can encourage them to buy more and stay loyal to the brand.



By applying these steps, the company can increase total sales, strengthen customer relationships, and make better decisions based on real data from the dashboard.
